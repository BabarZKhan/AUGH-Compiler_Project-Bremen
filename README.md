# AUGH-Project-Bremen

AUGH stands for Autonomous and User-Guided High-level synthesis. I have worked with AUGH compiler for an academic research project [FDL2021](https://babarzkhan.github.io/publication/2021-09-09-FDL2021), and [DTA](https://babarzkhan.github.io/publication/2018-03-25). The main goal was to try arbitrary precision types and floating point. However, this was not possible with the AUGH.
